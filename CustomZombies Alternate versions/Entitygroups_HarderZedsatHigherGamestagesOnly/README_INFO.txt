Entitygroups_Harder Zombies at Higher GameStages Only. Vb.01

Wastelands have easy and medium zombies. It is a harder biome.

I have reworked the entitygroups so the easy will appear at the beginning. When you reach gamestage 50, easy and some medium difficulty zombies will appear with low chance.
When you reach 200, The easy zombies will still appear, but more medium difficulty zombies will appear at higher chance.
When you reach 400+, Medium zombies will appear a lot and some harder zombies and even some nightmare with very low chance.
When you reach 800+, Harder appear often and even nightmare zombies can appear but with a medium chance. When you get higher those will increase too.

This is also for some of the animals. Some animals can spawn in the beginning with a very low chance. In the burnt biome for example, the fire snake. 
In the desert biome, The anaconda and the burning phoenix. In winter biome the diamond phoenix.

Cold can still show up in snow biome. There is 2 freezers. One easy and one medium.

At Gamestages 0-49  : Very easy zombies only
At Gamestages 50-100: Easy/Medium zombies
At Gamestages 200-400: Medium/hard/nightmare zombies : Gunner, FireBoss, Predator, Atrocity for example.
