VERSION 2.82
• Increased experience for most of the zombies. Now you get a lot more of EXP!
• Lowered puke and hand damage and Increased for the tougher zombies.
• Lowered hand/arm range for most of the zombies. For example normal size zombies have only 1.7 in range now instead of 1.75. Bigger size need a bit longer reach to actually hit. As Giant for example.
• Reduced Iron Mans range to 1.9. He had about 2.0 before. The Pickaxes in his hands probably are longer than 20cm, but it's almost impossible to evade his attacks if I make the reach any longer.

2021-12-31 (v2.80):

• Reworked Entitygroups to make it smaller size.
•  Lowered chance for harder zombies to appear. 
Harder zombies can still appear in early game and that is because they are in groups without gamestages. 
Without them there, my zombies would probably not be around so much on the outside. I have almost removed fireboss, gunner and RPG from the wanderinghordestages. 
They are just too strong.

• AquaZeds vomit is now slower.
• Blazingmans vomit ammo reduced. Less burst.
• Shockers vomit ammo reduced. Less burst.
