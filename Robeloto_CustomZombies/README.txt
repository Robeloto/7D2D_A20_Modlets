Nerf them all - Removed a lot of trader rewards and what you can buy from traders. For example Schematic Tools, Workstations, and tools. The schematic that can be found at traders have a very low chance.


2021-12-31 (v2.80):

• Reworked Entitygroups to make it smaller size.

•  Lowered chance for harder zombies to appear. 
Harder zombies can still appear in early game and that is because they are in groups without gamestages. 
Without them there, my zombies would probably not be around so much on the outside. I have almost removed fireboss, gunner and RPG from the wanderinghordestages. 
They are just too strong.

• FireElf has only 42 arrows in his magazine now instead of 60.
• Some zombies have now increased HP.

• Any Giant will have a chance to get you a concussion and knockdown chance is increased.

• The new mutated Giant has a different new sound now.

• Anesthesias melee has decreased chance to make you drugged

• AquaZeds melee has decreased chance to make you drowning.

• AquaZeds vomit is now slower.
• Blazingmans vomit ammo reduced. Less burst.

• Shockers vomit ammo reduced. Less burst.

• RPGs rockets fires a bit faster and have a higher lifetime. (vomit will not disappear too fast, not sure if this can be CPU-heavy, let me know)

• RadRobots HP reduced, but vomit fires around him. New robot sounds!
